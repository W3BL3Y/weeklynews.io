      <h1>Breaking News!</h1>
      <h5><i>February 1, 2021</i></h5>

      <p class="psa"><i>This is still an ongoing case, so updates will come as we know them.</br>
        Please be advised that this event has only ever happened once before! </br>
        Only by an act of God could this ever happen!</i></p>

      <p class="first-p">It was an evening like all other evenings that came before it. A man and woman
      had just laid their child to bed. He had been complaining of not wanting to go
      to sleep. The parents had assured him, though, that it was to his benefit that
      he slept so he could grow big and strong. The two parents went on with their evening as usual.</p>

      <p class="break">So far, nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

      <p class="second-p">Dogs barked in the evening air, cats prowled their territory. The couple watched television.
      They were watching the news. The guest that night was talking about sibling rivalry and how
      it's healthy to build that to a degree. It promotes drive, competitiveness, and teaches one how to lose.
      After the guest concluded the man went to get a small snack while the woman took a shower. That's when
      he heard it...</p>

      <p class="third-p">A <i>CRASH</i> came from the child's room! The father dropped his half-eaten snack and rushed to check
      on his pride-and-joy.</br>
      There was a cat sitting on the windowsill as if it was his throne. It had knocked off the box-fan
      that was propped up against the window. As the man shooed the cat away he heard something coming
      from the bed. He walked over to his child and leaned in...</p>

        <p class="add" data-aos="fade-left"><strong><i>"Two plus two is four"</br>
          "Two plus two is four."</i></strong></p>

      <p class="fourth-p">The father was perplexed. He had not taught the child any addition
      as of yet, but the child was adding in his sleep. He told his wife what their child was doing
      and she didn't understand, either. They had decided to ask the child about it the next morning.
      It was too late to wake the child and ask.</p>

      <p class="fifth-p">The family woke to the father's alarm and had their breakfast. They did not ask the child about
      his talking in his sleep. They figured that if it continued they will address it then. </br>
      After breakfast, the man took a shower and started to get ready for the day. He had a busy schedule
      ahead of him. Meanwhile, after the man's shower, the woman had to use the bathroom herself.
      As the man was saying his goodbye's, the woman came out of the bathroom bewildered. The man caught sight
      of this and asked if everything was okay. The woman looked at the man that she loves, smiled and said,</p>
